Read the data in R and browsed through data and Checking how many missing values in each of the columns

```{r}
# remove cols with no value at all and extra bathooms column(with greater NA percentage) as we have bathrooms_text with more values

Now the data is saved in new df zurich1 with only cols that have values, removed- bathrooms, calender_update, license, where the entire columns had no values.

review_scores_value has 730 NA's, imputing missing values with mean(4.629) or median (4.71) may not be appropriate as NA means it must not have been reviewed yet as the listing is new or no one has lived there to review. So, create a new category called "No Reviews"

```
Imputed missing beds values such based on room type and accommodates combinations. If room type is shared room, then assigned beds to the value of accommodates. This assumes that the number of beds in a shared room is equal to the capacity of accommodation.
If room type is private room or entire apartment, accommodates 1 or 2 people, then assigned beds=1, this assumes that for small accommodations, there is likely only one bed available.
If the room type is private room or entire apartment, accommodates 3 to 8 people, then assigned beds = accommodates /2 and rounded to nearest integer. This assumes that for larger accommodations, the number of beds is approximately half of the accommodation capacity.

Replacing another pattern in baths which was not covered in extraction steps a little above.

**SUMMARY of IMPUTATION PROCESS**
1. Reviewed the data and removed any columns that have no values at all like bathroooms, calender_updated and license columns. Then proceeded to extract baths from bathrooms_text. Then extracted price as numeric and stored in a new variable NumPrice. Then grouped the data based on District(neighborhood_group_cleansed) and neighborhood variables and computed mean price for each subgroup, and imputed the missing values in that subgroup with the mean NumPrice for that sub group. Contemplated using linear regression to impute, but proceeded with simpler mean imputation. Later for missing values in bed followed the following strategy: 

Imputed missing beds values such based on room type and accommodates combinations. If room type is shared room, then assigned beds to the value of accommodates. This assumes that the number of beds in a shared room is equal to the capacity of accommodation.
If room type is private room or entire apartment, accommodates 1 or 2 people, then assigned beds=1, this assumes that for small accommodations, there is likely only one bed available.
If the room type is private room or entire apartment, accommodates 3 to 8 people, then assigned beds = accommodates /2 and rounded to nearest integer. This assumes that for larger accommodations, the number of beds is approximately half of the accommodation capacity.

Then created two more variables guests per bed and guests per bath, as those ratios may provide a better indication of comfort than single beds or bath or accommodates variables in the classification/predictions models that come later.

It appears, in the next 30 days there are no Private rooms available in City, Kreis 1 to rent. And no shared rooms in Schwamendingen-Mitte, no hotel rooms in Langstrasse and no shared rooms in Gewerbeschule

**Summary statistics: **
1. Mean prices are calculated for each combination of neighborhood circle and actual neighborhood.
2. price per guest is calculated  for each listing and then Mean of price per guest for each sub group- neighborhood.
3. Median price for each neighborhood in a district is calculated.
4. Number of listings
5. Price variability or standard deviation for each neighborhood in a district is calculated.
6. Also Minimum and maximum price in the listing of each neighborhood for a district is calculated.

Low Supply in District and Neighborhood:
From summary statistics generated we can see that the supply(only 8 listings) is very low in district Kries12, neighborhood Saatlen

Highest Supply in Districts:
The highest supply(maximum listings) is from Kreis11- Oerlikon, Kreis1- Rathaus with 134 and 129 listing respectively. These districts have the most options available for accommodation.

The mean price per guest is lowest in Kreis11- Affoltern at 46.9 CHF, this indicates that accommodations in this area tend to be more affordable on a per-guest basis.
The mean price per guest is the highest in Kreis1- City at 146.625 CHF, this suggests that accommodations in the city center are typically more expensive per guest.

Also , we notice high price variability in Kries 2 Enge with standard deviation of 1007.7, this suggests that there is a wide range of prices among listings in this area, with some being significantly more expensive or cheaper than the average. 
and Kreis2 Leimbach has low price variability with 33.52,  indicates that prices among listings in this area are relatively consistent, with less variation compared to other districts.

In addition, it appears, in the next 30 days there are no Private rooms available in City, Kreis 1 to rent. And no shared rooms in Schwamendingen-Mitte, no hotel rooms in Langstrasse and no shared rooms in Gewerbeschule

  scale_fill_manual(name= "District")
```
The mean price per neighborhood ordered in increasing order. Enge stands out as having the highest mean price per guest, which is consistent with its high standard deviation, suggesting greater variability in prices.
```{r}
# Plot to visualize mean price per guest across neighborhoods

    theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1))
```
All neighborhoods seem to me more or less in the same price range, except for City, Lindenhof, which seem costly neighborhoods
Confirming our summary stats above, we can see that mean price guest is highest in Enge because of high standard deviation. Otheriwse City and Lindenhof are costly neighborhoods.

```
The above visualisation provides a way to understand how airbnb listings are distributed across neighborhoods and roomtypes within a district of Zurich. We see that there are greater number of hotels available in District1/Kreis1
Overall there are very few shared rooms available in Zurich. Mostly entire home or apartment is listed. The listings are generally for all room types in District12 or Kreis 12

```{r}
# Plotting availability by room type for each neighborhood

ggplot(zurich_availability, aes(x=meanAvailability, y= fct_reorder(neighbourhood_cleansed,meanAvailability),fill=room_type))+
   geom_bar(stat= "identity")+
  labs(x= "Mean no of days available", y= "Neighborhood", fill= "Room Type")+
  ggtitle("Availability in next 30 days")
  #geom_text(aes(label= meanAvailability), position= position_dodge(width= 0.9), vjust= -0.5, color= "black", size =3)
  
```
If a certain color bar is not seen, it means either that neighborhood has no available properties to rent or that there no properties of the type in that neighborhoods.

# Neighborhoods by rating

zurich_rating <- zurich2 %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood_group_cleansed,neighbourhood_cleansed, room_type) %>%
  arrange(neighbourhood_group_cleansed,neighbourhood_cleansed, room_type) %>%
  summarize(meanRating = mean(review_scores_rating, na.rm= TRUE)) 

head(zurich_rating,5)
```
Mean rating is calculated for each neighborhood.
```{r}
# Plotting ratings for neighborhoods
ggplot(zurich_rating)+
  geom_point(aes(x= meanRating, fct_reorder(neighbourhood_cleansed,meanRating),color=room_type))+
  labs(x= "Mean Rating", y= "Neighborhood", color= "Room Type")+
  ggtitle("Mean review rating by neighbourhood")
```
In the above graph if the rating is zero, it could also be because of no reviews. In general private rooms seem to have good ratings.

```{r}

zurich3$AcceptanceCategory <- ifelse(is.na(zurich3$AcceptanceRate),
                                      "Not available",
                                      ifelse(zurich3$AcceptanceRate > mean_acceptance,
                                             "High acceptance",
                                             "Low acceptance"))

zurich3$AcceptanceRate <- as.numeric(zurich3$AcceptanceRate)

zurich_acceptance <- zurich3 %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood_group_cleansed,neighbourhood_cleansed, room_type) %>%
  arrange(neighbourhood_group_cleansed,neighbourhood_cleansed, room_type) %>%
  summarize(mean_acceptance= mean(AcceptanceRate, na.rm= TRUE))

ggplot(zurich_acceptance, aes(x=mean_acceptance, y= fct_reorder(neighbourhood_cleansed,mean_acceptance)))+

  scale_color_brewer(palette="Set1")+
    theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1))
```
In general the host accpetance rate seems to be good, but there are few a hosts with low acceptance rates in City, Unterass, etc..This information can help guests gauge the responsiveness and willingness of hosts to accept booking requests in different neighborhoods.
